    <h5>Hello, I'm Daniel Tadesse</h5>
    <p>
      I am a senior at Mount Rainier High School who is interested in Computer Science. I was born in Jimma, 
      Ethiopia and moved to America when I was 6. Despite battling a language barriar, I love meeting new

      Community College Through Dual Entrolment. Eventually, I plan on attending a university and getting 
      my Bachlors or Masters degree.

      <h1 class="heading">Basketball</h1>
      <p>I play varsity basektball for my school as well as for AAU clubs.
        I have been playing basketball since 7th grade and it's my favorite hobbie. I've learned
        hard work and dedication through basketball. Basketball is a common
        language when meeting new people and has opened many new doors for me.
